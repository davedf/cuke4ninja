	<p>This document is a step-by-step guide for Cucumber,
	a tool that is quickly becoming the weapon of choice for many agile teams when it comes to functional test automation, creating
	executable specifications and building a living documentation. We believe in iterative development so we write and publish iteratively.</p>
