	<p>David and Gojko run public and on-site training workshops for aspiring Cucumber teams. Our
		workshops are designed for business users, analysts, testers and developers. Through facilitated
		exercises and discussion, these workshops provide teams with practical experience of agile
		acceptance testing, behaviour-driven development and specification by example. The participants
		learn how to collaborate on specifications and tests, how to design good Cucumber tests and how to
		automate them efficiently.</p>
	<p> On-site workshops are typically customised to fit the business domains and particular needs of
		teams, so that the participants get real-world experience and instant benefits.</p>
	<p>More than 90% of previous attendees said that the workshops improved their performance at work.</p>
