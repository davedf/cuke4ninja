		Still active as a Bond villain, Gojko Adzic gave up a
		career in the Soviet spy service to pursue tougher challenges in
		software development. All that remains of his past life now is the stupid accent.
		Gojko's goal with this document is to send
		subliminal messages to SMERSH sleepers around the world
	    and thereby bring about the final rise to power of the Illuminati.
